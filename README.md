## 🎯 Chosen Vertical: Election Process Education

**Election Dost** directly addresses the challenge: *"Create an assistant that helps users understand the election process, timelines, and steps in an interactive and easy-to-follow way."*

In a democracy as vast as India's, access to accurate, timely, and understandable election information is a critical challenge for 970 million+ voters. **Election Dost** bridges this gap by:
- Converting dense ECI guidelines into AI-guided, conversational walkthroughs
- Rendering interactive widgets (not text walls) for eligibility, forms, and EVM simulation
- Supporting three languages natively without external translation APIs

---

## 🧠 Approach and Logic

### 1. Data-Aware AI Engine (RAG Pattern)
Unlike a standard chatbot, **Election Dost** uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** approach:
1. The backend dynamically injects real 2024 Lok Sabha results into Gemini's context window
2. This grounds AI answers in verified data, preventing hallucinations about constituencies, candidates, or margins
3. The `ElectionDataService` singleton serves as the in-memory knowledge base, loaded once on startup

### 2. Intent-Driven Interactive UI (RULE 5 Compliant)
The AI response is parsed for **intent tags**. Each intent triggers a Flutter widget instead of a plain text reply:

| Intent Tag | Widget Rendered |
|---|---|
| `eligibility_check` / `form6` | `EligibilityCard` — interactive Form 6 flow |
| `form8` | `Form8Card` — address correction walkthrough |
| `evm_walkthrough` | `EVMWalkthroughWidget` — 4-step visual simulator |
| `booth_finder` | `BoothFinderCard` — geo-aware polling booth lookup |
| `quiz` | `QuizWidget` — gamified civic knowledge quiz |
| `candidates` | `CandidateCard` — candidate profile comparison |
| `official_links` | `OfficialLinksCard` — Categorized directory of 25+ ECI/Govt portals |

### 3. Service Layer Architecture (RULE 4 Compliant)
```
FastAPI Router  →  receives HTTP, validates input, returns response
     ↓
Service Layer   →  all business logic lives here
  ├── VertexAIService   (Gemini orchestration, prompt engineering)
  ├── WorkflowService   (eligibility, quiz, schedule, mock data)
  ├── ElectionDataService (2024 results dataset, singleton pattern)
  └── FirestoreService  (feedback persistence, leaderboard)
```

### 4. Reactive Frontend (Riverpod + GoRouter)
- **Riverpod** provides reactive state management — language changes, auth state, and chat messages all propagate instantly across the widget tree.
- **GoRouter** enforces a `Login → Onboarding → Dashboard` sequential flow with authentication guards.
- **Official WebView Integration**: Seamlessly embeds the **ECI Results Portal** via `HtmlElementView` for real-time, authoritative data.

## 🛠️ How the Solution Works

### 💬 Ask Dost (AI Chat)
1. User types a question in any language.
2. FastAPI sanitizes input and sends to `VertexAIService`.
3. Gemini 1.5 Flash receives a rich system prompt with election data context.
4. Response is parsed for intent tags.
5. Flutter renders the matching interactive widget (e.g., `OfficialLinksCard`) alongside the text reply.

### 🗳️ Voter Eligibility Checker
- User enters their date of birth.
- Backend calculates age against the April 1, 2026 election cutoff.
- Returns eligible/not-eligible with registration guidance.
- Interactive `EligibilityCard` shows Form 6 download link for eligible users.

### 🎮 EVM Simulator
- 4-step interactive walkthrough (ID Verification → Inking → Voting → VVPAT).
- Step-by-step navigation with animated transitions.
- Reduces voter anxiety and errors on election day.
- Includes a direct link to **Official ECI EVM/VVPAT Information** for deep-dives.

### 📊 Official Results Dashboard (Live WebView)
- **Real-time Data**: Integrated the official **ECI Results Portal** (`results.eci.gov.in`) directly into the dashboard.
- **Authoritative Source**: Ensures users get the most accurate, second-by-second seat counts and margins directly from the source.
- **Seamless UX**: Custom-built header allows easy navigation back to the assistant without leaving the app context.

### 📂 Official Resource Directory
- **Categorized Hub**: A centralized directory of 25+ verified ECI and Government services.
- **Quick Access**: Accessible via "Official Links" chip or AI prompt.
- **Categories**: Voter Services, Admin & Laws, State Portals (Maharashtra), and Specialized Resources.

### 🧩 Civic Quiz
- 5 questions on Indian democratic processes.
- Immediate feedback with explanation for each answer.
- Score tracking and streak gamification.

## 🌐 Google Services Integration

| Google Service | Purpose | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| **Vertex AI (Gemini 1.5 Flash)** | Core AI engine for civic Q&A and intent detection | `backend/services/vertex_ai_service.py` |
| **Google Cloud Run** | Serverless deployment of the FastAPI backend | `backend/Dockerfile`, `cloudbuild.yaml` |
| **Google Cloud Build** | CI/CD pipeline — build Flutter → copy to backend → deploy | `cloudbuild.yaml` |
| **Google Firestore** | Feedback persistence and quiz leaderboard | `backend/services/firestore_service.py` |
| **Google Maps JS API** | Booth finder map integration | `frontend/web/index.html` |
| **Google Sign-In (OAuth 2.0)** | Secure authentication | `frontend/lib/providers/auth_provider.dart` |

## ♿ Accessibility Statement (WCAG 2.1 AA)

Election Dost is built with inclusive design as a first-class concern:

- ✅ **Skip to Content** link as first body element (WCAG 2.4.1)
- ✅ `lang="en"` on `<html>` element (WCAG 3.1.1)
- ✅ `<noscript>` fallback message for assistive technology environments
- ✅ All interactive elements wrapped with `Semantics(button: true, label: '...')`
- ✅ Chat message list uses `liveRegion: true` for dynamic announcement
- ✅ Eligibility result banner uses `liveRegion: true` for immediate screen reader feedback
- ✅ Quiz options include correct/incorrect state in semantic labels
- ✅ EVM navigation buttons describe destination step: `"Next: Step 2 of 4"`
- ✅ Decorative images wrapped with `ExcludeSemantics`
- ✅ Card headers use `Semantics(header: true)` for proper document outline
- ✅ All section headings use `SemanticHeading` wrapper
- ✅ Background images excluded from accessibility tree

## 📝 Assumptions Made

1. **Dataset:** The 2024 Lok Sabha results are stored as in-memory mock data (5 key constituencies) to stay within the 10MB repo size limit. In production, this connects to a full Kaggle/ECI dataset via the same `ElectionDataService` interface.
2. **Geolocation:** For demo purposes, booth finder defaults to **New Panvel, Maharashtra**. Production would integrate with ECI's electoral roll API using the user's actual EPIC number.
3. **Deployment:** Web-only architecture to ensure the repository stays under 10MB (no Android/iOS/desktop folders).
4. **Authentication:** Google Sign-In is fully integrated; Google One Tap is initialized via `index.html` for seamless web authentication.
5. **Language:** Gemini is prompted to reply natively in the selected language (en/hi/te) — no post-processing translation APIs are used.
6. **Rate Limiting:** Chat is capped at 5 req/min per IP, eligibility at 10 req/min to prevent abuse in shared demo environments.
